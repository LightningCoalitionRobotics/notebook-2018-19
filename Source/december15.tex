	\item work on autonomous
\item mount ball arm
\item work on stronk boi
\item work on tele-op
\end{itemize}

% Now add a paragraph explaining your plan. You should reference the bullet points above.
We planned to continue working on what we were working on last practice. I planned to work on the arm more, Gabe wanted to work on an error he was having with the encoders. Sherry and Zoey wanted to connect the arm. Noah wanted to work on the tele-op

\section{What We Got Done:} % Just like the above, explain what the team got done during practice.
\begin{itemize}
% After \item, add what you want for the bullet point. (\item adds a new bullet point when you run out.)
	\item made progress on autonomous
\item made progress on tele-op

Zoey looked at her design for the arm and looked at placement in the chassis but decided to redesign it. I decided i didn't want to work on the stronk boi today so I just did other work.
