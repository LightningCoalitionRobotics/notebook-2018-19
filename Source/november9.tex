November 9th - Chris Lonergan

\section{Our Plan:} 
\begin{itemize}
% After \item, add what you want for the bullet point. (\item adds a new bullet point when you run out.)
	\item Finish designing and brainstorming mechanism to get balls and blocks into  
	\item Print out a stability test with a new printer filament (TCP)
\end{itemize}

We wanted to fully complete the design of the arm we will be using to pick up the blocks and balls and storing them. We had 3 designs but none of them were fully tested and they each have major flaws.

\section{What We Got Done:} 

We managed to print a test with the new TCP filament in the shape of a boat. This filament was for use in one of the designs we are thinking about using to pick up blocks and balls.

\section{What We Didn't Get Done:} 

We were not able to finish designing all of our options for our arm.

\section{Next Practice:}

Next practice, we want to finish designing our arm mechanisms, and try to figure out which one would be most effective. As well as that, we would like to continue working on coding the autonomous portion of the robot, as well as quality check that every part of the robot is working as it should.
