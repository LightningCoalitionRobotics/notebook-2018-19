\section{Website Proposal}
The Key School Robotics Team wishes to buy a domain in order to host our robotics website. This website is created and maintained by the robotics team. Nothing will be placed on the website without permission from Derek. We plan to promote our team to other teams or to sponsors. Currently, we have no logos of the Key School on the website, but we hope to add a logo if this is approved.
