December 28, 2018 - Kenneth A. Casey 
\section{Our Plan:} % Pretty self explanatory... In this section explain the team's plan.
\begin{itemize}
% After \item, add what you want for the bullet point. (\item adds a new bullet point when you run out.)
	\item Notebook

	\item Autonomous Code

	\item Collection Chamber

	\item T-shirt Design

\end{itemize}

% Now add a paragraph explaining your plan. You should reference the bullet points above.
Dylan will work on editing previous notebook entries. Gabe and Noah will work on the autonomous program. Nathaniel will design the collection chamber. Kenny will help others and work on today’s journal. Dylan will work on a design for this year’s t-shirt.

\section{What We Got Done:} % Just like the above, explain what the team got done during practice.
\begin{itemize}
% After \item, add what you want for the bullet point. (\item adds a new bullet point when you run out.)
	\item Notebook

	\item Autonomous Code

	\item Collection Chamber

	\item T-shirt Design

	\end{itemize}


% Now add a paragraph explaining what you got done and the reasons behind it. You should reference the bullet points above.
Dylan completed her previous notebook entry and drafted some T-shirt designs. Noah fixed bugs in the autonomous and found new bugs to fix. Gabe worked on the localization for the autonomous program. Nathaniel completed the design for the collector. Kenny completed this Journal entry. 

\section{What We Didn't Get Done:} % Explain what the team didn't get done during practice.

% Now add a paragraph explaining what you didn't get done and the reasons behind it. You should reference the bullet points above
            Noah and Gabe worked hard on the autonomous program, but many bugs appeared which caused it to not be finished.  The collection chamber needs to be 3D printed and installed on the robot. The team needs to select a t-shirt design and order t-shirts.
\section{Next Practice:}
\begin{itemize}
% After \item, add what you want for the bullet point. (\item adds a new bullet point when you run out.)
